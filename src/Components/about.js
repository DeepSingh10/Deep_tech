      <h2>We are in this together</h2>
        <p>SoLo’s story starts the way every SoLo request begins: with someone needing a hand. Our founders were noticing that family members, friends, and roommates were asking for financial help here and there, and they understood why. There weren’t any fair, reputable options for small, short-term loans. And so they set out to create one by harnessing the power of community.</p><br />
        <p>SoLo was formed in 2018 to create a viable, non-predatory option for moments when life happens. We tap into the power of community and generosity to form an online safety net that is mutually beneficial to all of our members.</p><br />
        <p>We know that SoLo is needed because we needed it. Our loved ones needed it. And we know that SoLo makes a difference because nearly 80% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. We are proud of what we've built, of this community, and of the future of financial autonomy that we envision and are paving together. Today, we’re driven to new heights, but grounded in the same hope and mission: to build a community that enables financial autonomy for all.</p>
